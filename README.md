# RustForm

An investigation into an enterprise without JavaScript

[Blazor](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/aspnet/web-apps/blazor) is on its way up, as are several Go WebAssembly frameworks and of course there are plenty of [Rust Frameworks](https://blog.logrocket.com/the-current-state-of-rust-web-frameworks/) under development.

Personally I'm not comfortable using frameworks unless I understand how they work, so this project will likely end up becoming my own simple web framework.  There will be likely be no backend but how to do this is a primary consideration.

In parallel I'm doing investigations into more "gamey" software with rustwasm, but I need to keep these separate to reduce confusion.

Also interested in related topics:
- [wasi](https://wasi.dev) - could this replace docker?
- gRPC in Rust - could this be an E2E secure microservices website built entirely in Rust?

## Useful commands

`wasm-pack build` build wasm package
`wasm-pack test --headless --firefox` run tests in headless browser
`wasm-pack publish` publish to npm, doubt I'll be doing this.

`npm install` (one-off) grab all web dependencies from package.json
`npm run start` run app with live reloading using webpack
`npm run build` build app using webpack
